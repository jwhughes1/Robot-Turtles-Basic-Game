Please place your code editor and GUI frame side by side.

We sent you an invite to a new repository for Milestone 4.

Please put background image in the same directory as the project so you can see the background image on the frame. if image is not loaded for some reason, you can still play the game, you just wont see the background image, but you can still see the GUI.

Turtles are represented with circles, and direction arrows ( "^" , " > " , " < " , " v " )
Jewels are represented with diamonds.
